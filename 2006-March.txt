Subject: [Nikud-general] help please with nikud for ivritex
Message-ID: <1142233658.3268.1.camel@sun-i-am>

I sent this to itai and yotam individually. now i discovered the mailing
list, so i'm sending to the mailing list in case someone else knows what
I need to do.  Thanks in advance.  BTW itai's email seems to be wrong.

I downloaded the stuff from nikud.berlios.de and installed it as it
says to.  (I have debian. So I have ivritex apt-got and installed.  It's
babel 3.7 so I got that texmf tree from your nikud site and merged it
with my system's texmf tree using rsync.)

I went into the samples and tried to run them through latex, after
converting from ucs to cp1255 like you said (both manually, and with
'make').  

LaTeX gives me the following errors:

----------------------------------
LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `cp1255/cmr/m/n' will be
(Font)              scaled to size 11.00006pt on input line 6.

Please tell me what I can do to fix this. I really want to be able to
use nikud in latex.  Thanks.

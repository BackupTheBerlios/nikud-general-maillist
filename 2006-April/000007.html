<PRE>Dear Friend,

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe
everyone will die someday. My name is Zayed Sultan a merchant in London, the
United Kingdom I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .

It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only
about a few months to live,according to medical experts.I have not
particularly lived my life so well,as I never really cared for anyone(not
even myself)but my business. 

Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people
and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But
now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just
wanting to have or make
all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to
come to this world I would 
live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has
called me, I have willed and given 
most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members
as well as a few close 
friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to
give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on
earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the
Algeria and Malaysia. Now 
that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I
once
asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the
money which I
have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused
and kept the money to
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be
contended with what I have left 
for them. 

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of eight
million united states dollars $8,000,000,00 that I have with a
finance/Security Company abroad. I
will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity
organizations. I have also set out 
10% of this money to be giving to the less privileged in Sri lanka,indonesia
and Thailand 15% has being 
set aside for you and for your time.

You are to respond through my personal and safe email address. God be with
you.

Regards,

Mr. Zayed Sultan.
